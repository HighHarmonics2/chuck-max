# chuck-max

A project to minimally embed the [chuck](https://chuck.stanford.edu) engine in a Max/MSP external.

It currently has one external (`chuck~`) with the following features and limitations:

- Generate and process audio via an embedded chuck engine by running chuck files with `global` parameters controlled and adjusted in realtime by Max messages.

- Layer sounds from a single instance by running multiple chuck files concurrently.

- Add, remove, replace audio and audio processes on the fly using Chuck messages via Max messages.

- Includes most of the [base ccrma chugins](https://github.com/ccrma/chugins) including `WarpBuf` and `Faust` or (Fauck) except for the following:

  - Fluidsynth
  - Ladspa

- The `chuck~` object can take the following arguments:

  - `[chuck~]` : single channel in/out, no default chuck file
  - `[chuck~ <filename>]` : single channel in/out with default chuck file
  - `[chuck~ <N> <filename>]` : N channels with default chuck file

- As of the current version, `chuck~` maps a few chuck language elements to corresponding Max/MSP constructs as per the following table:

| action                            | chuck              | max msg                      |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------  | :--------------------------  |
| change param value                | global variable    | `<name>` `<value>`           |
| trigger named event               | global event       | `sig <name>`                 |
| trigger named event all shreds    | global event       | `broadcast <name>`           |
| trigger named callback            | global event       | `sig <name>`                 |
| trigger named callback all shreds | global event       | `broadcast <name>`           |

- In addition a decent number of the core Chuck vm messages are available as Max messages:

| action                            | max msg                      | max msg (alias)              |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------  |
| add shred                         | `add <file>`                 | `+ <filepath>`               |
| remove shred                      | `remove <shredID>`           | `- <shredID>`                |
| remove last shred                 | `remove last`                | `--`                         |
| remove all shreds                 | `remove all`                 |                              |
| replace shred                     | `replace <shredID> <file>`   | `= <shredID> <file>`         |
| vm status                         | `status`                     | `^`                          |
| clear vm                          | `clear vm`                   | `reset`                      |
| clear globals                     | `clear globals`              |                              |
| reset id                          | `reset id`                   |                              |
| time                              | `time`                       |                              |
| probe chugins                     | `chugins`                    |                              |
| list of running shreds            | `info`                       |                              |
| get/set loglevel (0-10)           | `loglevel` | `loglevel <n>`  |                              |


See `help/chuck~.maxhelp` and patchers in the `patchers/tests` directory for a demonstration of current features.

Also note that `chuck-max` has a sibling in the [pd-chuck](https://github.com/shakfu/pd-chuck) project.

This project is currently built on the chuck 1.5.2.3-dev (chai) engine.

## Requirements

Note that this external is currently only developed and tested on macOS, although a Windows version is on the TODO list.

It requires the following to be available on your system:

1. Xcode from the App store or Xcode Command Line Tools via `xcode-select â€“install`

2. cmake

3. bison

4. flex

The last three can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as follows:

```bash

brew install cmake bison flex

```

## Compilation

Currently building on macOS is only supported. The buildsystem consists of a minimal Makefile frontend with CMake driving the build on the backend.

To get up and running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shakfu/chuck-max.git
cd chuck-max
make setup
```

Note: `make setup` does two things: (1) retrieve `max-sdk-base` via a git submodule and makes the package and its contents available to be used by Max by creating a symlink of the `chuck-max` folder in `$HOME/Documents/Max 8/Packages`.

From this point you have three options: 

1. `make`: Base system: (external + base ccrma chugins)

2. `make full`: Base system + Faust and Warpbuf chugins with full libsndfile format support

3. `make light`: Base system + Faust and Warpbuf chugins with libsndfile support only .wav files.


Also note that by default `make` builds the external according to the *native* architecture of the mac it is compiled on. You can build the base system with universal support by typing `make universal` instead.

If there's a need to update and re-build the external just type the following in the root of the project.
7
```bash
git pull
make
```

### Install the Warpbuf Chugin (Optional)

With WarpBuf you can time-stretch and independently transpose the pitch of an audio file.

This chugin can be built by `make full` instead of `make` in the build process above or if you are just using cmake then set option -DENABLE_WARPBUF=ON 

### Install the Fauck Chugin (Optional)

The [fauck chugin](https://github.com/ccrma/fauck) contains the full llvm-based [faust](https://faust.grame.fr) engine and dsp platform which makes it very powerful and also quite large compared to other chugins (at around 45 MB stripped down). It requires at least 2 output channels to work properly.

This chugin can be built by `make full` and `make light` options instead of `make` in the build process above or if you are just using cmake then set option -DENABLE_FAUCK=ON 

A future aim is to include a stripped down version of this fauck chugin which only supports .wav files and and only contains the faust standard library in an official `chuck-max` package.

CAVEAT: the Faust chugin has unresolved cleanup bug which may cause Max to crash after all patch windows are closed and Max is exited.


## Usage

Open the help file `help/chuck~.maxhelp` for a demo. Check out the `patchers` folders for further examples of use.


## Missing Chugins

There are two CCRMA chugins which are not yet supported by `chuck-max`:

1. `Ladspa`: not yet supported but known to compile without issues.

2. `Fluidsynth`: not yet supported.


## Status

## Credits

This project thanks the following:

- Professors GE Wang and Perry Cook and all chuck and chuggin contributors for creating the amazing ChucK language and chuggin ecosystem!

- Professor Perry Cook for co-authoring Chuck and creating the [Synthesis Toolkit](https://github.com/thestk/stk) which is integrated with chuck.

- Professor [Brad Garton](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/brad) for creating the original [chuck~](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/brad/chuck~) external for Max 5. My failure to build it and run it on Max 8 motivated me to start this project.

- David Braun, the author of the very cool and excellent [DawDreamer](https://github.com/DBraun/DawDreamer) project, for creating the excellent [ChucKDesigner](https://github.com/DBraun/ChucKDesigner) project which embeds chuck in a Touch Designer plugin. His project provided a super-clear blueprint on how to embed `libchuck` in another host or plugin system and was essential to this project.
